CodeFellows 301 Final Project: Play&Rest

Synopsis: This application is designed to help the user locate nearby play areas(for children and dogs alike) and water access points. This uses the Google Maps API to populate a map which then has data points added to the display via database calls and Javascript logic. There is a search feature with auto-filling text and filtering options depending on user preference. Note the data is only available currently for the City of Seattle. 

Languages/Libraries: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, PageJS, Handlebars, JQuery, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL.

API's Used: Google Maps, Google Places, City of Seattle Open Data Api's (3).  

Last Update: April 4, 2018.

Contributors: Ryan Groesch, Joanna Coll, Scott Thompson, Collin Meredith.
